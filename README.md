Login / Logout Menu Item WordPress Plugin
=========================================

This plugin was developed on behalf of the [Philly GiveCamp][givecamp] for
use by [The First Tee of Greater Philadelphia][firsttee]. It's a quick and
dirty plugin built for the very specific purpose of providing a login link
in the navigation menu for an unauthenticated user and a logout link for an
authenticated user via a filter function.

The source code for this plugin is derived from posts on [WordPress.org's
forums][wp] and on [StackExchange][stackexchange].
